                    <p>I am an archaeologist, researcher, writer, and Ph.D. Candidate in the Religious Studies Department at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. My work concentrates on the intersection of religious material culture and the archaeology of the Ancient Near East, with a focus on ancient Judaism and early Christianity.</p>
                    <p>I grew up in the Dutch speaking part of Belgium and was as a child already fascinated by history, archaeological excavations, and the world of museums. I ended up studying archaeology of the Ancient Near East at the University of Gent, Belgium and later moved to the Netherlands to study Hebrew and Aramaic at the University of Leiden. Before I moved to the US for my Ph.D. research, I worked at the National Museum of Antiquities of the Netherlands in a variety of positions. It is there that I discovered my love for artifacts, heritage management, and working in the public sector.</p>
                    <p>I am writing my dissertation on the coin deposits found in synagogues in Late Antique Palestine. For this project, I am building a database through the visualization platform Prospect. In the first phase, I am cataloging the coins from 30 different sites to be able to cross-reference the deposits and implement statistical analysis.

                    I also teach undergraduate classes through the UNC Friday Center and I am a part of several excavation projects in Israel. I am on the board of several organizations, including that of the ASOR Early Career Scholars Committee, the Carolina Center for Jewish Studies, and the Levantine Ceramics Project.</p>
